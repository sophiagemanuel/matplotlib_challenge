Module 5 Assignment 
In this module assignment we work with matplotlib and plotting data. Our code is seperated by the titles with '##'. We use our code to clean data we are given, create a summary statistics, create bar and pie charts, quartile, outlier, and boxplots, and correlation and regression lines.
For this assignment, the most trouble I believe I had was when it comes to the for loop when creating the quartile, outlier, and boxplots for the four groups. I used this website for help: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp
The code I created was based off of the examples from module 5 that we completed in class, and put them together to complete my assignment.
