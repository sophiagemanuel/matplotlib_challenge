# matplotlib_challenge
## Introduction
In this Module 5 assignment, we work with Matplotlib to plot and visualize data. The project involves cleaning the given data, creating summary statistics, and generating various plots such as bar charts, pie charts, boxplots, and regression lines.

## Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Generation of summary statistics
Creation of bar and pie charts
Quartile, outlier, and boxplot analysis
Correlation and regression line plots

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Matplotlib
Pandas
NumPy
SciPy

## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning section includes steps to load and preprocess the data, handling missing values and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

## Summary Statistics
Summary statistics are generated to provide an overview of the data, including measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

## Visualizations
Various visualizations are created to analyze and present the data:

**Bar Charts**: Used to compare different categories.
**Pie Charts**: Used to show proportions of a whole.
**Boxplots**: Used to display the distribution of data and identify outliers.
**Regression Lines**: Used to show relationships between variables.
For creating quartile, outlier, and boxplots, a for loop is used to iterate over four groups, following examples and assistance from W3Schools Python For Loops (https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp).
